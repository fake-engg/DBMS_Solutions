Previous Query (Finding Salesmen with Above Average Sales):
It calculated the average sale amount for each salesman and then compared it to the overall average sale amount (calculated in the subquery).
The HAVING clause filtered for salesmen whose average sales were higher than the overall average.

Current Query (Finding Salesmen with High Total Sales):
This query calculates the total sales amount for each salesman. 
It then compares this total to the overall average sale amount (still calculated in the subquery). 
The HAVING clause now finds salesmen with a total sales amount that is greater than the average sale amount (regardless of how many sales they made).
