SELECT Sname FROM (select sm.Sname, sl.Sid, COUNT(sd.Quantity)
FROM Salesman sm JOIN Sale sl ON sm.Sid=sl.Sid JOIN Saledetail sd ON sl.Saleid=sd.Saleid
GROUP BY sl.Sid, sm.Sname HAVING COUNT(sd.Quantity)>2);

Made some changes in the Query. I missed one logic in the previous query.
Question was asked for "Atleast 2 Sales"


SELECT Sname FROM Salesman WHERE Sid IN (SELECT Sid FROM Sale GROUP BY Sid HAVING COUNT(Saleid)>=2);
