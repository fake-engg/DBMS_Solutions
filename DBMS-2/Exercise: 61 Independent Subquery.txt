SELECT Prodid, Pdesc FROM Product WHERE Prodid IN 
(SELECT Prodid FROM Saledetail GROUP BY Prodid HAVING SUM(Quantity)=
(SELECT MIN(SUM(Quantity)) FROM Saledetail GROUP BY Prodid))

#Step1: We need to Calculate the Min. sum of a quantity

SELECT MIN(SUM(Quantity)) FROM Saledetail GROUP BY Prodid

--> This is a single row query

Step2: Now we can fetch those Prod ids which have min quantity

SELECT Prodid FROM Saledetail GROUP BY Prodid HAVING SUM(Quantity)=
(SELECT MIN(SUM(Quantity)) FROM Saledetail GROUP BY Prodid)

Step3: Now we can use this Prod id to fetch all the required Details from Product table

--> So this makes our final query

SELECT Prodid, Pdesc FROM Product WHERE Prodid IN 
(SELECT Prodid FROM Saledetail GROUP BY Prodid HAVING SUM(Quantity)=
(SELECT MIN(SUM(Quantity)) FROM Saledetail GROUP BY Prodid))
